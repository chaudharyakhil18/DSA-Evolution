# Arrays & Hashing

Arrays and hash-based data structures (hash maps, hash sets) are the foundation of many DSA problems. This pattern focuses on:

- Counting frequencies and occurrences.
- Checking membership efficiently using sets.
- Using maps to store indices, counts, or prefix sums.
- Handling subarrays, duplicates, and common array tricks.

Typical problems include: Two Sum, group anagrams, longest consecutive sequence, subarray sums, and more.
