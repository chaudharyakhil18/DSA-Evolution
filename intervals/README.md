# Intervals

Interval problems involve ranges on a line (time intervals, numeric ranges, etc.) and require reasoning about overlaps and ordering.

Key patterns:

- Sorting intervals by start or end.
- Merging overlapping intervals.
- Inserting and placing new intervals.
- Using sweep-line or greedy strategies.
