# Two Pointers

The two pointers pattern uses two indices that move over the input (usually an array or string) to reduce time complexity and avoid nested loops.

Common scenarios:

- Pointers at both ends moving toward the center.
- Fast and slow pointers for cycle detection or length computations.
- In-place partitioning and filtering.
- Finding pairs or triplets that satisfy some condition.
