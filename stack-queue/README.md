# Stack & Queue

Stack and queue patterns appear in many iterative algorithms, parsing tasks, and BFS/DFS traversals.

Common usage:

- Using stacks for parentheses, undo operations, and monotonic sequences.
- Using queues for BFS, level-order traversal, and multi-source expansion.
- Designing monotonic stacks/queues for range maximum/minimum problems.
