# Graphs

Graph problems model relationships between entities and often involve traversal, connectivity, and shortest paths.

Key concepts:

- Directed vs undirected graphs, weighted vs unweighted.
- Representations: adjacency list, adjacency matrix.
- Traversals: BFS, DFS, topological sort.
- Connected components, cycles, and bipartite checking.
- Shortest path patterns (BFS, Dijkstra, etc.).
