# Trees

Tree problems are central to DSA, especially in interviews. Trees naturally express hierarchical data and are often solved with recursion or BFS.

Key ideas:

- Depth-first search (preorder, inorder, postorder) and breadth-first search (level order).
- Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and their invariants.
- Tree diameter, height, path sums, and LCA (lowest common ancestor).
- Serialization and deserialization of trees.
