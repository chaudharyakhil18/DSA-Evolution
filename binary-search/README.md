# Binary Search

Binary search is used when the answer lies on a monotonic (non-decreasing or non-increasing) space, not only on sorted arrays.

Typical uses:

- Classic binary search on a sorted array.
- Binary search on answer (searching over time, capacity, value, etc.).
- Custom predicates where you maintain `low`, `high`, and mid checks.

Careful handling of boundaries and termination conditions is critical.
