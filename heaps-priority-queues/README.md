# Heaps & Priority Queues

Heaps and priority queues are used when you frequently need to access the smallest or largest element while the collection is changing.

Typical patterns:

- Top-k elements.
- Streaming problems (maintain median, running extremes).
- Scheduling and merging sorted lists.

Most implementations rely on binary heaps with O(log n) insertion and removal.
