# Sliding Window

The sliding window pattern is used for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings. Instead of recomputing values from scratch, you maintain a "window" and update its state as it moves.

Key ideas:

- Fixed-size windows (e.g., length `k` subarrays).
- Variable-size windows that expand/contract based on constraints.
- Maintaining counts, sums, or frequency maps inside the window.
