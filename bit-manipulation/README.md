# Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is about using bitwise operations to solve problems efficiently, often in O(1) or O(n) time with low memory.

Key techniques:

- Using AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts.
- Setting, clearing, and toggling bits.
- Using bitmasks to represent subsets.
- Exploiting properties like `x ^ x = 0` and `x & (x - 1)` to count/set bits.
