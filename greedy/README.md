# Greedy

Greedy algorithms build a solution step by step, making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of reaching a global optimum.

Typical usage:

- Interval scheduling and merging.
- Choosing minimal or maximal elements repeatedly.
- Using sorting plus greedy selection.

A key skill is proving (or recognizing) when a greedy strategy is correct.
