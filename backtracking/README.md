# Backtracking

Backtracking is a systematic way to explore all (or many) possible configurations by building solutions incrementally and abandoning (backtracking) partial solutions that cannot lead to a valid answer.

Common applications:

- Generating subsets, permutations, and combinations.
- Solving constraint problems (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku).
- Exploring search trees with pruning.
