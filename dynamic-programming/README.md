# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is about breaking problems into overlapping subproblems and reusing results instead of recomputing them.

Core ideas:

- Defining a clear state: `dp[i]`, `dp[i][j]`, etc.
- Finding transitions/recurrence relations.
- Top-down (memoization) vs bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
- Space optimization (e.g., using O(1) or O(n) instead of O(n^2)).

Common categories: 1D DP, 2D DP, knapsack, LIS, subsequences, intervals, and tree/graph DP.
